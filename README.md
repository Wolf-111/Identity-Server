# Identity-Server

Backend for Identity - an open source mobile app that will allow you to create numerous online "identities" that provide you with a custom name, an email address (via SimpleLogin, a ProtonVPN service), & a VoiP phone number capable of voice and text (small monthly fee).

Currently work in progress.
